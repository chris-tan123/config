# Config

**Config** is a checklist I follow to set up a new Mac's development environment. It gets me up to speed with [...], and more so I can more quickly get back to coding.

## Contents

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.bash_profile` | Customizes the Terminal.app prompt and echoes the currently checked out Git branch. |
| `.gitconfig` | Global Git configuration to specify my name and email, shortcuts, colors, and more. |
| `iTerm` | Terminal replacement |
| `com.googlecode.iterm2.plist` | settings file for iTerm |

## Todo
[init] add a script to automatically move iTerm to Application folder
[job] regularly grab bash_profile/other settings and commit
